## Overview
This dataset is a curated collection of troubleshooting content for 3D printing, focusing on output quality issues.
It was manually constructed from three publicly available troubleshooting guides:
- Simplify3D
- Prusa3D Help
- All3DP

The original documents were fully reviewed, with redundant entries consolidated and irrelevant links or unnecessary examples removed to ensure conciseness and clarity.
Each entry is structured into three components:
1. Problem – Description of the print quality issue
2. Cause – Identified or potential reasons for the issue
3. Solution – Recommended corrective actions
The dataset is provided in both PDF and text formats for flexible use in machine learning and information retrieval research.
